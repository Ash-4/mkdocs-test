# Startup power

By default the Command station will start with the track power OFF. 
This can be inconvenient if you are using the free version of the WiThrottle app 
from the Apple store which does not have a power button.

You can configure EXRAIL to power on at startup by using
```
AUTOSTART POWERON DONE
``` 
Alternatively, you can power tracks individually
```
AUTOSTART
  SET_POWER(A,ON)
  SET_POWER(D,ON)
  DONE
```
