# Command station internal architecture

![Code structure](./07-command-station-arch.svg)


This diagram is old but basically ok. Needs editing to 

  - do better at css dark/light

  - TPL renamed to EXRAIL
  
  - have hotlinks on boxes to the relevant adres of the doc and/or the actual code modules in git.
  
  - maybe convert to mermaid.
