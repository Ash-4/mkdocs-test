# Getting Started with DCC-EX

If you are just starting here for the first time, it's more than likely you are interested in the possibility of using a DCC-EX Command Station to run some trains.

A Command Station is the electronic device that translates throttle commands, such as telling a loco to move, into electronic signals sent on the track to the loco. 

These signals are usually DCC  (Digital Command Control) which allows commands that control multiple locos on the same piece of track.

However, the DCC-EX Command Station is also capable of running DC (Direct Current) locos as there are millions of them still in use.

You have the option to buy a DCC-EX Command station ready-to-run or build it yourself from cheaper parts.

TODO-  continue at this kind of level and add links.
