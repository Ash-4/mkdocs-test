# Installing Command Station firmware

Your command station cannot operate without the appropriate firmware which must be configured in advance to suit the hardware target.

Once your initial Command Station build is operating, you will almost certainly wish to make use of additional features such as defining turnouts, rosters, signals, routes, animations and other varied accessories. In each case, we make it as simple as possible but you do need to use the appropriate tools to re-install the firmware to incorporate your changes.

The [EX-Installer](/installer/01-installer.md) guides you through the process.
