# Build Your Own Command Station

DCC-EX started life on home-built command stations using Arduino UNO and Mega processors and the standard Arduino motor shield. This was attractive to users that liked to experiment and was exceptionally cheap to create. However, if you build your own, or even buy a pre-built stack from a third party, you will need to learn quite a lot more than using our plug-and-go solution the [CSB1](?CSB1).

You will find that lots of "standards" are not at all standard, and that apparently attractive alternatives to the recommended items and totally incompatible. You may need to configure the software or even modify hardware shields. You will require a multimeter, a soldering iron and a variety of dupont wires or similar and you will probably collect a bucket-load of connectors, adapters, and gizmos that you though might be useful but don't have time to try.

In fact, TIME is the thing you will need most, and time spend building your command station is just too easy an excuse for not building your track!

The following documentation pages can only take you through the basics and should you contact us for support it is well to remember that we do this for fun, we don't get paid, and we don't all have access to the same weird but cheap gizmo you found on the web with an instruction sheet in Klingon.

Apart from that... it's great fun.
