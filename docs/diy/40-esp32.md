# Complex Build - ESP32

ESP32-WROOM-32 was selected as the microprocessor for the EX-CSB1. &nbsp;Although folks are encouraged to use the EX-CSB1, this information should assist in building an ESP32-based DCC-EX command station.

- **Caution:**&nbsp; Other ESP32 modules (S2, S3, C3 etc.) are **NOT** supported. &nbsp;Other ESP32 modules do not have the necessary RMT hardware, or do not have enough such hardware to run DCC-EX.

- ESP32-WROOM-32 advantages  
  \- Built-in WiFi  
  \- Memory  
  \- Sniffer/Booster capable (with additional optocoupler circuit)  

- ESP32-WROOM-32 is more complex than using the Arduino Mega  
  \- GPIO pin numbers are used (vs. Arduino style pin location numbers)  
  \- ESP32 pins are not 5V tolerant  
  \- I2C bus is 3.3V  
  \- Soldering is required to modify the WeMos D1 R32/ESPDUINO-32 board  
  \- Modifications are required for motor shields to protect ADC input pins  
  \- ADC input range begins at 0.15V  
  \- ESP32 Espressif boards package version 2.0.17 is required

# EX-CommandStation - ESP32-WROOM-32

- ESP32-WROOM-32 is the only ESP32 which can presently be used to run EX-CommandStation software.

## WeMos D1 R32

- WeMos D1 R32/ESPDUINO-32 has the Uno form factor.

- WeMos D1 R32 boards have some obvious hardware errors:  
  \- Pullup voltage to the IO0 pin is too high (4.2v instead of 3.3-3.8v) which leads to unreliable WiFi.  
  \- IOREF pin does not output 3v3, but instead breaches the UNO R3 specification and outputs 5V.  
  \- A0 and A1 pins cannot be used for ADC input when WiFi is used.

- There are other ESP32-WROOM-32 boards with the Uno form factor which might work, but these will require a custom motor define when there are differences in GPIO pin locations.

## ESP32-WROOM-32 Development boards

- ESP32-WROOM-32 Development boards come in various sizes and pin configurations.

- 38-pin and 30-pin boards are common.

- Only the ESP32-WROOM-32 variants can be used.
