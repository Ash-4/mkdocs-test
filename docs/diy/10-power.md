# Selecting a power supply

You will require a power supply unit to provide track power and to run the Command Station processor.

## Volts and Amps

The volt and current requirements for your track vary according to the scale of your locos and the number you expect to run simultaneously.

TODO - voltage/amps choice table

## When using an EX8874 or CSB1

The EX8874 (which is also built in to the CSB1) provides power for both the track and the Command Station. There is almost zero voltage drop between the power supply and the track.

We strongly advise purchasing a suitable power supply at the same time as the CSB or EX8874 from a vendor who understands your requirements.

## Other motor shields

Should you have the temerity to choose a motor-shield other than the EX8874:

- you must allow for the voltage drop within your chosen shield.
- you must provide separate power for the Command Station processor, most easily via the USB socket. A standard phone charger, or a connection to a computer, will be adequate. Other options are significantly more complex.
- you may not be protected from reverse-polarity mistakes.

## What to look for

Typically, retired or replacement laptop power supply bricks are suitable and readily available. You need to check their markings:

- Volts and Amps suitable for your trains and layout (see above)
- Double square safety markings.
- Plug polarity indicator, center positive.

## SAFETY WARNING

![DANGEROUS](/_static/images/power/dangerous.png){ align=right }

A Command Station is NOT a typical consumer electronics device where the user is never in contact with any bare wire of any voltage.  Your track is effectively a large bare wire that will be touched frequently.

You MUST use a suitable, double insulated, power supply where it is not possible for a loose wire or stray flexi-track clipping from your model building to fall in and bridge the gap between mains voltage and the output.

Should this happen, it could melt your electronics, locos or children.
