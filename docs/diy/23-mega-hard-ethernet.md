# Optionally installing an Ethernet shield

The standard Ethernet shields must be first in the stack as they use pins that are not passed through the headers of the motor shield. Look underneath the shield and this will become obvious. The shields also cause issues with their height, shields above may not sit level (but will still work) unless you introduce an extra row of header extenders.

Non-shield Ethernet adapters have other wiring requirements. Search our help for [details](?Ethernet).
