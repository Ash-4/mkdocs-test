# Standards and Formatting Guide

This guide outlines the standards to adhere to for page naming, directory structure, and other related items, along with guides on how to use the various markdown attributes and other MkDocs Material extensions we have enabled to enhance the documentation.

## Mandatory Standards

We try to keep as few mandatory standards as possible, but these items must be adhered to in order for our documentation to be maintainable.

### General Content

When creating content, remember to keep the target user in mind at all times, with a strong preference to Conductor level users. A significant (and growing) proportion of our user base do not understand software, nor a lot of electronics or embedded systems. Use terminology they are likely understand.

Most importantly, *keep pages concise, to the point, and avoid excess words or waffle*. Not only does this make the key messages hard to read, but maintaining lengthy pages that are a wall of text becomes onerous, daunting, and reduces the likelihood of keeping our documentation current.

### Page Naming and Titles

- All page names must be in lower case and use "-" instead of spaces where appropriate.
- If specific page ordering is required, simply preface with the appropriate page number eg. "1-standards-formatting.md".
- The page title is determined by the top level heading, see [Headings](#headings).

### Directory Structure

Note firstly that we use the [MkDocs Awesome Nav plugin](https://lukasgeiter.github.io/mkdocs-awesome-nav/) to control the menu structure, which uses a ".nav.yml" file in any directory where the default needs to be overridden.

The top level directories under the "docs" directory determine the tabs or horizontal menu items on the header bar, with the subsequent directories and files in each of these determining the menu on the left pane.

**Do not adjust the top level directories without consulting the DCC-EX Documenter team, as these fundamentally adjust the user experience.**

If a new top level directory is to be added, it needs to be added to the "/docs/.nav.yml" file in the appropriate order. Files and directories created within existing top level directories will automatically be added to the menus (see [Page Naming and Titles](#page-naming-and-titles) for page ordering).

### Page and Section Links

All links to other pages and sections should be relative, not absolute. We have enabled a setting to ensure links are relative to the "docs" directory, and enable permalinks for headings to support this:

```markdown
[Link to How to Contribute](/contributing/1-contribute-docs.md#how-to-contribute)
```

Results in: [Link to How to Contribute](/contributing/1-contribute-docs.md#how-to-contribute)

Links to sections on the same page should just use the permalink section heading name:

```markdown
[Link to this section](#page-and-section-links)
```

Results in: [Link to this section](#page-and-section-links)

## Headings

Headings are simply defined by one or more leading ``#``, noting you can only have one top level heading on a page, which is the page title.

The top level heading defines how the page appears in menus, so for this page this is the top level heading:

```markdown
# Standards and Formatting Guide
```

Further, this general section on "Headings" is a second level heading:

```markdown
## Headings
```

Following are how to define the lower level headings with a demo of each.

### Heading Level 3

```markdown
### Heading Level 3
```

#### Heading Level 4

```markdown
#### Heading Level 4
```

##### Heading Level 5

```markdown
##### Heading Level 5
```

## Internal and External Links

There are three types of links you can use:

- Section links - link to another section heading on the same page
- Document links - link to another document, or a section heading on another document
- External links - link to an external website

## Code blocks

When including code blocks, be sure to include an appropriate language for syntax highlighting, and use triple backtick "`" characters to surround the code for highlighting.

For example:

````cpp
```cpp
TURNOUTL(id, address, "description")

TURNOUT(id, shortAddress, subAddress, "description")
```
````

Will render as:

```cpp
TURNOUTL(id, address, "description")

TURNOUT(id, shortAddress, subAddress, "description")
```

For EXRAIL and general configuration file code blocks (eg. config.h, myAutomation.h), "cpp" is as good as any, and for any others use an appropriate language specifier.

If appropriate, line numbers can also be displayed by appending ``linenums="X"`` to the language, where "X" is the starting line number:

````cpp
```cpp linenums="20"
TURNOUTL(id, address, "description")

TURNOUT(id, shortAddress, subAddress, "description")
```
````

Will render as:

```cpp linenums="20"
TURNOUTL(id, address, "description")

TURNOUT(id, shortAddress, subAddress, "description")
```

This is a nonsense C++ code block generated by Gemini to demonstrate the full syntax highlighting:

```cpp

#include <vector>    // For dynamic arrays
#include <string>    // For string manipulation
#include <map>       // For key-value pairs

namespace MyLibrary {

const double PI_VALUE = 3.1415926535; // A global constant

    // Display details using a loop
    std::vector<GenericItem> inventory;
    inventory.push_back(item1);
    inventory.push_back(*item2);

    std::cout << "--- Inventory Details ---" << std::endl;
    for (const auto& item : inventory) { // Range-based for loop
        item.displayDetails();
        std::cout << "-------------------------" << std::endl;
    }

    } catch (const char* msg) { // Catching a C-style string
