- ## :material-hand-wave-outline: Welcome to DCC-EX

    DCC-EX is a team of dedicated enthusiasts producing open source DCC and DC solutions to run your entire model railroad layout.

    Our easy to use, ready-to-run and do-it-yourself products use either our own custom hardware or off-the-shelf Arduino and similar technology.

    Our free and open source EX-CommandStation software is supported by numerous third party hardware and apps like JMRI, Engine Driver, wiThrottle, Rocrail and more.

    Our mission is to provide free and open source software and hardware designs to make model railroading accessible and affordable to everyone. Read more about our entire “EX”-osystem of offerings in the following pages.
