- ## :material-hand-wave-outline: Welcome to DCC-EX

    Our Command Station is highly regarded as one of the best you can get and has many unique features that are specifically designed to bring control and fun to your hobby.

    - Wifi access, with DCC-EX unique features, from the "Gold Standard" (Jimmy..TODO LINK) [Engine Driver](https://enginedriver.mstevetodd.com/) on Android, [ThrottleCard](https://throttlecard.com/) on iOS and a wide variety of other Apps. We can even show you how to build your own throttle.
    - The ability to run DCC and DC trains from the same throttle at the same time.
    - The powerful but easy [EXRAIL](/products/ex-commandstation/exrail/1-exrail.md) scripting language to configure and control accessories such as turnouts, signals, lights, and sounds. It can also run trains automatically and animate your layout!
    - Integration with [JMRI](https://www.jmri.org/), [iTrain](https://www.berros.eu/en/itrain/), and [RocRail](https://wiki.rocrail.net/) if you prefer to run trains from your computer.
