# DCC-EX Model Train Control, Animation, and Automation

DCC-EX is a team of dedicated enthusiasts producing open source **DCC** and **DC solutions** to run your model trains and layout.

Our easy to use **ready-to-run** and **do-it-yourself** products use either our own custom hardware or off-the-shelf Arduino and similar technology, and are in use by modellers from all over the world to control their trains and accessories as well as animate and automate their layouts.

Our **free and open source** EX-CommandStation software is supported by numerous third party hardware and apps like JMRI, Engine Driver, WiThrottle, Rocrail, and more.

**Our mission** is to provide free and open source software and hardware designs to make model trains accessible and affordable to everyone.

We now have a broad "EX"-osystem of other products to enhance your entire layout including an integrated fast clock, integrated turntable controller, and I/O expansion.

You can use the quick links below to find out more about our products, or navigate through the menus above (or at the top left on mobile and small screens).
