# DCC-EX Model Train Control and Automation

DCC-EX is a team of dedicated enthusiasts producing open source **DCC** and **DC solutions** to run your model trains and layout.

Our easy to use **ready-to-run** and **do-it-yourself** products use either our own custom hardware or off-the-shelf Arduino and similar technology.

Our **free and open source** EX-CommandStation software is supported by numerous third party hardware and apps like JMRI, Engine Driver, WiThrottle, Rocrail, and more.

**Our mission** is to provide free and open source software and hardware designs to make model trains accessible and affordable to everyone.

We now have a broad "EX"-osystem of other products to enhance the control and automation of your entire layout including an integrated fast clock, integrated turntable controller, and I/O expansion.

You can use the quick links below to find out more about our products, or navigate through the menus above (or at the top left on mobile and small screens).
