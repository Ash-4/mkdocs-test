# DCC-EX Model Railroading

DCC-EX is a team of dedicated enthusiasts producing open source **DCC** and **DC solutions** to run your entire model railroad layout.

Our easy to use **ready-to-run** and **do-it-yourself** products use either our own custom hardware or off-the-shelf Arduino and similar technology.

Our **free and open source** EX-CommandStation is supported by numerous third party hardware and apps like JMRI, Engine Driver, WiThrottle, Rocrail, and more.

**Our mission** is to provide free and open source software and hardware designs to make model railroading accessible and affordable to everyone. Read more about our entire "EX"-osystem of offerings in the following pages.
