<div class="grid cards static home-top-row" markdown>

- ## :material-hand-wave-outline: Welcome to DCC-EX

    Our Command Station is highly regarded as one of the best you can get and has many unique features that are specifically designed to bring control and fun to your hobby.

    - Wifi access, with DCC-EX unique features, from the "Gold Standard" (Jimmy..TODO LINK) [Engine Driver](https://enginedriver.mstevetodd.com/) on Android, [ThrottleCard](https://throttlecard.com/) on iOS and a wide variety of other Apps. We can even show you how to build your own throttle.
    - The ability to run DCC and DC trains from the same throttle at the same time.
    - The powerful but easy EXRAIL scripting language to configure and control accessories such as turnouts, signals, lights and sounds. It can also run trains automatically!
    - Integration with [JMRI](https://www.jmri.org/) [iTrain](https://www.berros.eu/en/itrain/), [RocRail](https://wiki.rocrail.net/) if you prefer to run trains from your computer.

    Or you can enjoy [building your own](/diy/1-diy.md), staggeringly cheap, version from readily-available Arduino parts in use by modellers from all over the world. We have even designed parts to make this easy for beginners, no soldering required!  
    <br>
    Of course, we also have a wealth of information for more adventurous builders if you have the appropriate electronics skills.
