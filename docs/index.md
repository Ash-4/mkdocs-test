<div class="grid cards static home-top-row" markdown>

- ## :material-hand-wave-outline: Welcome to DCC-EX

    DCC-EX is a team of dedicated enthusiasts producing open source **DCC** and **DC** solutions to run your model trains and layout, with the mission to provide free and open source software and hardware designs that make model trains accessible and affordable to everyone.

    Our easy to use software products use either our own custom hardware or off-the-shelf Arduino and similar technologies, are in use by modellers from all over the world, and are supported by numerous third party hardware and apps like JMRI, Engine Driver, WiThrottle, Rocrail, and more.

    We now have a [broad "EX"-osystem of products](/products/index.md) to enhance your entire layout including an integrated fast clock, integrated turntable controller, and I/O expansion.
