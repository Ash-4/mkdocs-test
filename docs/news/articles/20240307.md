# Another new EX-Installer release

The |DCC-EX| team is pleased to announce another new release of |EX-I| (version 0.0.18). As always, we encourage all users to download this new version of the installer to take advantage of the bug fixes and new features available.

<!-- more -->

The key updates in this release are support for the new options available in |EX-TT| version 0.7.0, and the ability to save the device logs from the Device Monitor screen directly within |EX-I|. This way, when interacting with the |DCC-EX| team in Discord or via either means, when asked to provide the startup logs or serial monitor logs, you can simply open Device Monitor and click the ``Save log`` button to obtain these.

This release also includes the below changes:

- Update a Python module version to resolve security vulnerabilities
- Add a link to |DCC-EX| News articles about |EX-I| to the Info menu
- Ensure the "Backup config files" popup is always launched within the app window geometry
- Fix a bug where copying existing config files for |EX-TT| and |EX-IO| causes an exception
