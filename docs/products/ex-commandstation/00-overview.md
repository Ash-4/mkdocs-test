# The DCC-EX Command Station

A DCC Command Station powers your track and sends digital signals to the locos and accessories through the track. All commercial command stations do that, but we think we do it a lot better for a lot less money.

Our primary solution is the [EX-CSB1](01-ex-csb1.md) CommandStation which provides a ready-to-run system with integrated WiFi. You can start running trains from your Android phone in a couple of minutes if you plug your track in one end and a power supply in the other.

- If you want to buy a ready built command station, see [Purchase a Command Station](?Purchase) and come back here to learn about it while you are waiting for the delivery.

- If you want to build your own command station and are prepared to learn about Arduinos see [Building your own Command station](?DIY) but you are advised to read the basic guidance that follows so you will have a better understanding of what you want to achieve, and what will be possible.

- If you already have a DCC-EX command station, read on.

To follow the basic setup process, you can use the "next" button seen at the bottom right of each page.
