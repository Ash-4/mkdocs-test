# Signals with flashing

Flashing is achieved with the command

```cpp
BLINK(vpin, onMs, offMs)
```

which will start a vpin blinking until such time as it is SET, RESET or set by a signal operation such as RED, AMBER, GREEN.

BLINK returns immediately, the blinking is autonomous.

## Always blink AMBER

A signal that always blinks amber could be done like this:

```cpp
SIGNALH(130,131,132)
ONAMBER(130) BLINK(131,500,500) 
DONE
```

The RED or GREEN calls will turn off the amber pin and that will stop the blink automatically.

## Amber and Flashing Amber

A signal that has normal AMBER and flashing AMBER could be done by creating a new macro to implement a FLAMBER(signalid) command

```cpp
// create a new command
#define FLAMBER(signal) \
        AMBER(signal) \
        BLINK(signal+1,500,500)

SIGNAL(130,131,132) 

// then where necessary you can 
AMBER(130)   // set signal to AMBER
// or 
FLAMBER(130) // set signal to flashing amber
```

(Caution: this assumes that the amber pin is redpin+1 in the SIGNAL or SIGNALH definition)
