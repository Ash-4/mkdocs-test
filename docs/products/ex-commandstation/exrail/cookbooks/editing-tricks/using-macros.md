# Using C++ Macros

The EXRAIL language is compiled by C++ and this means you can use MACROS of your own design according to the C++ compiler [pre-processor specification](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/cpp/Macros.html).

A MACRO is essentially a tiny program that types stuff for you while substituting parameters.

For example: This macro can be used to start two leds flashing alternately at half second intervals:

```cpp
#define FLIPFLOP(led) \
   BLINK(led,500,500) \
   DELAY(500) \
   BLINK(led+1,500,500)
```

Notice that a C++ macro must be only one logical line long! So we must use the `\` character on the end of the line to indicate that this line is continued on the following.

In the above example, the FLIPFLOP macro takes a LED [VPIN](?VPIN) and starts flashing it, then half a second later it starts flashing the next pin in line. Since the delay and the on/off period are the same, the LEDs will flash alternately.

So you might use it in a sequence like this:

```cpp
ONBUTTON(30)
   FLIPFLOP(32)  // start flashing leds 32 and 33
   DELAY(4000)   // wait 4 seconds
   SERVO(123,1033,Slow) // close crossing gates
   DELAY(3000) // give red-light jumpers a chance to consider their life choices
   GREEN(34) // change approach signal to green
   DONE
```

and

```cpp
ONBUTTON(31)
   RED(34) // change approach signal to red
   SERVO(123,3200,Slow) // Open crossing gates
   RESET(32,2) // turn off the blinking on pins 32,33
   DONE
```

The servo positions above are of course dependent on your servos and how they are mounted. You must experiment first see [Servos](?servo).

Macros like these are, obviously, more useful if you use the macro in more than one place.
