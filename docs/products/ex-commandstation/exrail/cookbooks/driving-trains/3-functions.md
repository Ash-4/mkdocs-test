# Loco Functions

Functions can be set on or off. EXRAIL knows nothing about the meaning of each function because this is internal to the loco decoder.


- `FON(func)`  turns on a loco function
- `FOFF(func)` turns off a function

In more advanced cases, an automation driving a loco may need to manage functions on another address, perhaps carriage lights. This can be done with the commands

- `XFON(locoid, function)`
- `XFOFF(locoid, function)`

For eaxample:

```cpp
... while driving...
   AT(189)   // passing tunnel
   FON(0)    // loco lights on
   FON(8)    // make like a boy-racer  
   XFON(3001,0) // carriage lights on
   AT(190)   // at far end of tunnel
   FOFF(8)   // pretend we didn't do that
   FOFF(0)   // loco lights off
   XFOFF(3001,0) // carriage lights off
... and so on
```
