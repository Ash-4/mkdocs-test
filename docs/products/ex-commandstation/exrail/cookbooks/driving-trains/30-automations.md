# AUTOMATIONS

An AUTOMATION is a sequence of EXRAIL commands used to drive a loco.

By creating an AUTOMATION in EXRAIL, your throttle will show the automation on its Routes display. To send a loco along an AUTOMATION, you must first drive the loco to a point where the automation can start and then select the automation from the routes screen of your throttle.

The automation will take over driving the loco but you will still see the throttle moving if the loco changes speed. If you manually alter the speed with the throttle that will take effect normally as the automation spends most of its time in an AT command waiting for the train to reach a sensor, and will not wake up again until the sensor is detected. You may, for example, stop the train manually to fix a derailment, dropped rolling stock or cat sitting on the track. When you restart the loco and drive it to the sensor the automation is expecting, the automation will carry on.

Of particular interest, compared with a PC (JMRI, iTrain, RocRail etc) running the loco, EXRAIL is only interested in the sensor your task us trying to reach. This makes it vastly more efficient than even the fastest PC system.
