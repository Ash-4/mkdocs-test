# Using CALL and RETURN

Where you want to use the same sequence of commands from several places in other sequences you can avoid copying the repeated stuff by using CALL and RETURN

```cpp
ROUTE(1,"Platform A to mainline")
  CALL(911)
  THROW(1)
  CLOSE(2)
  DONE

ROUTE(2,"Platform B to mainline")
  CALL(911)
  CLOSE(1)
  CLOSE(2)
  DONE

SEQUENCE(911)
  SERVO(123,100,Slow)  // move the cow out of the way
  PLAYSOUND(500,3) // Make it Moo
  DELAYRANDOM(5000,10000) // make the route wait 5 to 10 seconds
  RETURN      // return to the calling sequence
```

## Notes

- You can nest CALLs 4 deep.
- If the called sequence executes a ```DONE``` statement, the task is terminated and there is no return.
