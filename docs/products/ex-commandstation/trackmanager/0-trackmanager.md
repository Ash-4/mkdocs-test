# TrackManager

TrackManager is what lets you dynamically configure the outputs of your Command Station as either:

- Main DCC track output
- Programming DCC track output
- DC mode
- DCC Auto Reverse
- DCC Booster

Track A defaults to MAIN.  Track B defaults to PROG.  

Track mode can be defined in myAutomation.h  
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [Example: Set a track to DC](../exrail/cookbooks/dc-tracks.md)

This screen shows where track modes can be set with Engine Driver:

**NOTE:** &nbsp; DC output is only available with specific hardware requirements.
