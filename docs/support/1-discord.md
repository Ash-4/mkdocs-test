# Join the DCC-EX Discord Server

The DCC-EX team has a strong preference for providing support via the [DCC-EX Discord server](https://discord.gg/y2sB4Fp).

It is free to join, and provides these benefits over our other support methods:

- The DCC-EX team actively participate in Discord, so you can talk to the people who create the products
- There is a global community of over 4,000 DCC-EX users in Discord
- When people are online at the same time, you can have a live, interactive chat
- There is the opportunity for DCC-EX users to help other users, which happens frequently

In short, Discord gives you the best access to the broadest set of people who can help with DCC-EX; an entire, global community of users.

Please ensure when you first join, you review the Server Guide which will help you get started with our Discord server.

## Discord Channels

We have organised the Discord server into various channels which help keep similar topics grouped together.

Here are some examples of commonly used channels, and there are plenty more:

- ``#support-and-issues__ex-commandstation`` - Use this channel for general EX-CommandStation conversations and help
- ``#exrail`` - Use this channel for general EXRAIL conversations and help
- ``#tack-manager`` - Use this channel for general TrackManager conversations and help
- ``#accessories`` - Use this channel for topics such as PCA9685 servo controllers and servos, MCP23017 I/O expansion boards, and other accessories
- ``#sensors``
- ``signals``

Our other products typically have their own channel also:

- ``#ex-ioexpander`` - EX-IOExpander, not to be confused with other I/O expansion modules such as PCA9685 or MCP23017 devices, see ``#accessories``
- ``#ex-dccinspector``
- ``#ex-turntable``
- ``#ex-fastclock``

## Opening a Support Ticket

If you need help with a specific issue and the conversation in the general support channels haven't resolved the issue, you are welcome to open a support ticket in Discord to get help for your specific issue.

From the Server Guide, you can select the ``Open a Support Ticket`` option that will take you to the support channel, and clicking the ``Create Ticket`` icon will open a support ticket.

When doing this, only the DCC-EX support team members and yourself will have access to the ticket, but other users can be invited if necessary.

In order to help the DCC-EX team give you the help you need, you will need to provide as much information as possible, as we cannot read minds, see your setup, access your hardware or configuration files, nor look over your shoulder to see what is going on.

Please provide this information at the time you open the support ticket:

- [ ] The product and version
- [ ] The exact hardware in use
- [ ] Upload serial/console logs
- [ ] Upload all configuration files for the software in use
- [ ] Detail any troubleshooting steps you have already performed
