# Raising GitHub Issues

Most of the DCC-EX GitHub repositories have issue templates which will guide you through the required information related to the type of issue you are raising.

These typically include:

- Bug Report - Submit a bug report, preferably after interacting with the support team in Discord to validate it is a bug
- Documentation Update - Request an update to add missing information or report broken links or other inaccuracies
- Feature Request - Suggest a new feature you'd like to see
- Support Request - Request support or assistance, noting this is not as quick as interacting with the support team in Discord
