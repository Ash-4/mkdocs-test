# Help and Support

At some point you will likely need to get some help or support for our products, and the available methods are outlined on this page.

**NOTE** For users of hardware products purchased from resellers, in the event of a hardware issue please contact the reseller in the first instance. Each reseller is responsible for supporting the hardware they sell.

Please note that the DCC-EX team are all volunteers and are distributed globally, so while we endeavour to help as much and as quickly as we can, all support is provided on a best-effort basis only, and there will be times where no team members are available.

This is why we strongly recommend Discord as the best source of support, because there is a global community of over 4,000 users, some of whom may be able to help before a DCC-EX team member is online.
