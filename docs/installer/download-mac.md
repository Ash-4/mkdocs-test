### Download and install on MacOS

Download from here [macOS](https://github.com/DCC-EX/EX-Installer/releases/latest/download/EX-Installer-macOS){ .md-button }

Open a terminal window and navigate to the that folder that you downloaded the file to. e.g.:

```bash
cd Downloads
```

Enter the following command to tell the OS that it is an executable:

```bash
chmod +x EX-Installer-macOS
```

Run the installer with the following command:

```bash
./EX-Installer-macOS
```

On later macOS versions, go to Privacy & Security in System Settings, and scroll down to Allow applicaitons downloaded from "App Store and identified developers" and then when EX-Installer is blocked, click "Allow Anyway"
