# First Run installer

You will be presented with the Welcome screen…

![welcome](/_static/images/ex-installer/welcome.png)

This screen provides some basic information about the process of loading the Software. The font may be very small on a high quality screen so use the "tools sizing" menu to find a better zoom factor. 

To proceed, click the Manage Arduino CLI button.

This screen allows you to install or update the Arduino Command Line Interface (CLI).

We use the Arduino Command Line Interface (CLI) to upload the DCC-EX products to your Arduino. The CLI eliminates the need to install the more daunting Arduino IDE. EX‑Installer is able to manage the installation and updating of the Arduino CLI for you at the click of a button.

If you have not installed the CLI previously you will see an 'Install Arduino CLI' button.

If you have previously installed the CLI you will see a 'Refresh Arduino CLI' button.

**HINT:**

Expressif ESP32 is required for the EX‑CSB1

If you are using an Espressif or STMicroelectronics device (including the EX‑CSB1, as opposed to the other CPU based Arduinos, you will need to enable support for these by selecting the appropriate additional platform option.

**NOTE:**

Enabling additional platforms that you will not be using will take more space on your hard drive and is likely to add several minutes to the installation process.

You must have Arduino CLI installed to proceed, simply click the Install Arduino CLI button if it is showing.

If you already have the Arduino CLI installed, it is recommended that you refresh it periodically (e.g. weekly) to ensure support for the various device details are kept up to date. To refresh the CLI, simply click the Refresh Arduino CLI button.

Installing the CLI can take some time. Maybe grab a cup of tea or coffee, and watch magic happen!
